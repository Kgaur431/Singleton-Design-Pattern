  part 1.
1. we create these classes like Bird, Sparrow, Crow etc.  child class extends the Bird class. 
        1.1     Now we create an interface because we want bird to be able to create a copy of itself.
                        this interface is called as Cloneable. 
        1.2     We make the Cloneable interface as generics, so that whoever is using it, the clone method will return that type of obj. 
        1.3     Now Bird class implements the Cloneable interface & override his method.        
        1.4     Now We implement the Clones() in the Bird class also add some private attributes in the Bird class.
2.   We create Main class.
Problem A:-   go to docs, first.
