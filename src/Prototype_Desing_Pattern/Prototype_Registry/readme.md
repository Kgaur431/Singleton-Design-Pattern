 Prototype Registry:-
        1.  we have created BirdRegistry class.
        2.  it has Map to store the original objects of the birds.
        3.  it has registerBird().
        4.  it has getBird().
        
        we have added setter method in Crow class to create the diff obj of Crow type. 
        like intelligent_crow have nice sound. 
        
        In the Main class we will create an new obj of the Crow class as intelligent_crow & set the sound of that crow, instead creating a new child class of Crow called Intelligent_Crow
        that's how the Registry class is useful so that we don't have to create extra class just the change in value of the attribute.
