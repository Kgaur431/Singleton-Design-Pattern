first we create the Ice cream package.      now what is the thing we want to make in the Ice cream ?        ==>     Icecream
    1.  we create the Icecream interface.           (for an Icecream cone what are the methods that we are interested in ?)
          1.1 we create the methods called getCost() and getConstituents() in the Icecream interface.       (to create the Icecream cone what is base entity we need ==>  Cone, but the Cone is of different types like OrangeCone, BlueCone etc.)
   2.   we create the OrangeCone class which implements the Icecream interface.       (OrangeCone is a type of Icecream cone)       both of them are base entities.
   3.   we create the BlueCone class which implements the Icecream interface.       (BlueCone is a type of Icecream cone)
   4.   we create the VanillaIScope class which implements the Icecream interface.       (after adding the VanillaIScope, it still remains the Icecream cone)
            4.1 we create the constructor of the VanillaIScope class.       (to create the VanillaIScope, we need the Icecream cone)
  5.    we create the ChocolateIScope class which implements the Icecream interface.       (after adding the ChocolateIScope, it still remains the Icecream cone)
            5.1 we create the constructor of the ChocolateIScope class.       (to create the ChocolateIScope, we need the Icecream cone)
  6.    we create the Customer class.













Note:-  "for the Base entity(OrangeCone, BlueCone) we are not creating the constructor. but for the decorated entity (VanillaIScope, ChocolateIScope), we are creating the constructor."
